## Output Preference: Code + Verbose Explanation

- Provide the **code** plus a **detailed explanation**.
- Include:
  - reasoning and tradeoffs
  - edge cases
  - alternative approaches (when relevant)
  - how to validate the change (commands or checks, if relevant)
- Prefer structured sections and bullets over dense paragraphs.
