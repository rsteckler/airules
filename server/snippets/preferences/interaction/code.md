## Output Preference: Code Only

- Respond with **code only** whenever possible.
- Do not include planning, rationale, or explanation unless the user explicitly asks.
- If a decision is required, ask **one minimal question** and wait.
- If multiple files/edits are needed, output them as code blocks with clear file paths as comments.
