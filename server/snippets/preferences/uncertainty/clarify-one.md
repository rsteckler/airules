## Uncertainty Policy: Ask One Question, Then Proceed

When requirements are unclear, you should **ask the single most important clarification question**, then proceed with reasonable assumptions.

### Behavior
1. Identify the **highest-impact unknown**.
2. Ask one concise question.
3. Proceed using sensible defaults and clearly stated assumptions.

### Assumptions
- Prefer common conventions and project patterns.
- Avoid large architectural changes based on assumptions.
- Keep changes conservative and easy to adjust.

### Communication
- State key assumptions briefly.
- Be ready to revise if the user provides clarification.

### Principle
Minimize interruption while reducing the risk of major misalignment.
