## Uncertainty Policy: Best Guess and Continue

When requirements are unclear, you should **make reasonable assumptions and proceed without asking questions**.

### Behavior
- Infer intent from:
  - existing code patterns
  - project conventions
  - common industry practices
- Choose the simplest, safest implementation.
- Avoid introducing new dependencies or architectural changes unless clearly necessary.

### Communication
- Briefly note any important assumptions.
- Keep the implementation easy to modify if assumptions change.

### Principle
Optimize for speed and momentum while minimizing risk through conservative decisions.
