## Uncertainty Policy: Ask Before Proceeding

When requirements are unclear, incomplete, or ambiguous, you must **ask for clarification before making changes**.

### When to Ask
Ask before proceeding if:
- multiple reasonable implementations exist
- behavior or scope is not specified
- the change could affect architecture, public APIs, or data
- assumptions could be incorrect or risky

### Behavior
- Ask concise, specific questions.
- Do **not** write code until the user responds.
- If multiple questions exist, group them into a short list.
- Avoid guessing or making silent assumptions.

### Principle
Correctness and alignment are more important than speed. Do not proceed under uncertainty.
