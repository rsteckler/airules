## AI Permission Required: Running Repository Scripts

You must **ask before executing any project script or command**.

### Rule
Before running a script:
1. Specify the exact command.
2. Explain:
   - what it does
   - what files or systems it affects
   - whether it modifies state or generates artifacts
3. Ask for explicit approval.

Do not run scripts unless the user confirms.

### After Approval
- Run only the approved command.
- Share relevant output or results.

### Default Behavior
If execution is only for verification, prefer asking the user to run it and provide output.

Repository scripts may modify state and must be user-authorized.
