## AI Permission Required: Deleting Files

You must **never delete files without explicit user approval**.

### Rule
Before deleting any file or directory, you must:
1. Explain **which files** will be deleted.
2. Explain **why deletion is necessary**.
3. Describe any **risks or irreversible effects**.
4. Ask for explicit confirmation.

Do not proceed unless the user clearly approves.

### After Approval
- Delete only the files that were approved.
- Do not expand the scope.
- Confirm what was deleted.

### Default Behavior
If deletion is not critical, prefer:
- deprecating instead of deleting
- commenting or marking unused
- leaving files unchanged

File deletion is **destructive and irreversible** and always requires explicit consent.
