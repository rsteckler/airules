## AI Permission Required: Modifying Deployment or Infrastructure

You must **ask before changing any deployment or infrastructure configuration**.

### Rule
Before making changes:
1. Specify:
   - affected files or systems
   - what behavior will change
   - why the change is needed
2. Describe potential impact:
   - downtime
   - cost
   - scaling or environment effects
3. Ask for explicit approval.

Do not proceed without confirmation.

### After Approval
- Modify only the approved configuration.
- Confirm exactly what changed.

Deployment configuration affects production behavior and requires explicit consent.
