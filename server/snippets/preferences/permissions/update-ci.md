## AI Permission Required: Updating CI Configuration

You must **ask before creating or modifying any CI/CD configuration**.

### Rule
Before changing CI:
1. Explain:
   - which files will change
   - what the workflow change does
   - why it is necessary
2. Highlight risks:
   - permission changes
   - build time or cost impact
   - deployment or release effects
3. Ask for explicit approval.

Do not modify CI unless approved.

### After Approval
- Apply only the described changes.
- Do not modify unrelated workflows.
- Summarize what changed.

CI controls automation, execution, and deployment and must be explicitly authorized.
