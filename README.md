# Airules

**AI Rules Generator** — A React frontend and Node backend that guides users through a project questionnaire and generates AI agent rules (Cursor, Claude, etc.), with optional repo URL analysis to pre-fill answers.

## Plan

The implementation plan lives in the repo: **[docs/PLAN.md](docs/PLAN.md)**. It defines the product, architecture, questionnaire model, and a phased implementation order for agents.

## Getting started

_(To be filled in as the app is built.)_

- From repo root: `npm install` installs dependencies for all workspaces.
- **Client** (Phase 2+): `npm run dev` in `client/` to run the React app.
- **Server** (Phase 3+): `npm run dev` in `server/` to run the API.

## Repo structure

- `client/` — React app (Vite)
- `server/` — Node API (Express/Fastify)
- `docs/PLAN.md` — Single source of truth for the build plan
